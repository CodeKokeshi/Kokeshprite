# Symmetry Mirroring Bug Fix 🐛→✅

## The Problem

### What Was Happening:
When using multiple symmetry lines (Cross, X, Star), not all quadrants/octants were being painted.

**Example with Cross (+):**
```
Before Fix:
- Paint top-right → Only 3 points painted (missing bottom-left)
- Paint top-left → Only 3 points painted (missing bottom-right)
```

### Root Cause:
The old algorithm only mirrored the **original point** across each line:
```python
points = [(x, y)]  # Original
for line in lines:
    mx, my = line.get_mirrored_point(x, y)  # ❌ Only mirrors original!
    points.append((mx, my))
```

**Result with Cross (2 lines):**
- Original point: `(x, y)`
- Mirror across vertical: `(mx1, y)`
- Mirror across horizontal: `(x, my1)`
- **Missing:** `(mx1, my1)` ← The opposite corner!

## The Solution

### New Algorithm:
Mirror **ALL accumulated points** across each line, not just the original:

```python
points = {(x, y)}  # Start with original
for line in lines:
    new_points = set()
    for px, py in points:  # ✅ Mirror EVERY point we have so far
        new_points.add((px, py))  # Keep original
        mx, my = line.get_mirrored_point(px, py)  # Add mirror
        new_points.add((mx, my))
    points = new_points
```

### How It Works:

**Cross Pattern (Vertical + Horizontal):**

Step 1 - Start:
```
Points: {(x, y)}
```

Step 2 - Apply Vertical Line:
```
Take (x, y) → mirror → (mx, y)
Points: {(x, y), (mx, y)}
```

Step 3 - Apply Horizontal Line to ALL points:
```
Take (x, y) → mirror → (x, my)
Take (mx, y) → mirror → (mx, my)  ← This was missing before!
Points: {(x, y), (mx, y), (x, my), (mx, my)}
```

**Result:** 4 points = Full quadrant coverage! ✅

### Visual Example:

```
Cross Pattern (+ symmetry):
    
     (x, my)  |  (mx, my)
              |
    ----------+----------  ← Symmetry lines
              |
      (x, y)  |  (mx, y)
```

All 4 quadrants now get painted!

## Point Counts by Pattern

| Pattern | Lines | Points | Description |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Vertical | 1 | 2 | Left/Right |
| Horizontal | 1 | 2 | Top/Bottom |
| Cross (+) | 2 | 4 | All quadrants |
| X (diagonal) | 2 | 4 | Diagonal quadrants |
| Star (8-way) | 4 | 8 | Full octants (pizza!) |

## Technical Details

### Key Changes:
1. **Used `set()` instead of `list()`**
   - Automatically eliminates duplicate points
   - Important when lines overlap or share angles

2. **Iterative mirroring**
   - Each line doubles the point count (approximately)
   - Builds up the full symmetry group progressively

3. **Mirrors all accumulated points**
   - Not just the original point
   - Creates complete symmetry transformations

### Mathematical Correctness:
This is the proper way to compute a **symmetry group** - you apply each transformation to all existing points, building up the full orbit under the group action.

For geometers: We're computing the orbit of a point under the dihedral group D_n! 🤓

## Testing Checklist

### Cross Pattern (+):
- ✅ Paint top-right → All 4 quadrants paint
- ✅ Paint top-left → All 4 quadrants paint
- ✅ Paint bottom-right → All 4 quadrants paint
- ✅ Paint bottom-left → All 4 quadrants paint

### X Pattern (Diagonal):
- ✅ Paint any diagonal quadrant → All 4 paint

### Star Pattern (8-way):
- ✅ Paint any octant → All 8 octants paint
- ✅ Perfect mandala/snowflake symmetry

### Single Line:
- ✅ Still works correctly (2 points)

## Files Modified

- `src/symmetry.py` - Fixed `get_mirrored_points()` method

## Status

✅ **BUG FIXED!**

All symmetry patterns now work correctly with full coverage across all quadrants/octants!
